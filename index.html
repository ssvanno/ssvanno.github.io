  <h3>Untitled Bullet Hell Game</h3>
  <p>This is a game that my friend and I made for a school project within 10 days using the Unity game engine. It's a relatively short <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_hell">Danmaku</a> or bullet hell game inspired heavily by a game called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project">Touhou Project</a>. The game is not meant to be a full game but rather a demonstration of our ability to create a game within a short time frame.Which is why the game is a single boss fight that lasts around 2-3 minutes that is supposed to present a challenge to players who have some experience in games of this genre.  The game was created using Unity and C#.</p>
